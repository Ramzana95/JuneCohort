     <h2> What you will need: </h2>
      <ul>
       <li>185g unsalted butter</li>
       <li>185g dark chocolate</li>
       <li>85g plain flour</li>
       <li>40g cocoa powder</li>
       <li>50g white chocolate</li>
       <li>50g milk chocolate</li>
       <li>3 large eggs</li>
       <li>275g golden caster sugar</li>
      </ul>
     <h2>Method</h2>


       <ol>
       <li>Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a<br>medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small<br>pieces and drop into the bowl. </li>
       <br>
       <li>Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water,<br>then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the<br>pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until<br>the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring<br>occasionally to mix them.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the<br>bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for<br>2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to<br>room temperature.</li>
       <br> 
       <li>While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf<br>in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to<br>180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of<br>kitchen foil (or non-stick baking parchment) to line the<br>base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a<br>sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve<br>so they run through together and you get rid of any<br>lumps.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into<br>chunks on a board.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g<br> golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum<br>speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick<br>and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8<br>minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is.<br>You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really<br>pale and about double its original volume. Another<br>check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and<br>wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off<br>the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the<br>mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse,<br>then gently fold together with a rubber spatula.<br>Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath<br>and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the<br>middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of<br>eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you<br>can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are<br>one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is<br>to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as<br>gentle and slow as you like.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture<br>and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve<br>from side to side, to cover the top evenly.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight<br>action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at<br>first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very<br>gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and<br>fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t<br>want to overdo this mixing.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until<br>they’re dotted throughout.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every<br>bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the<br>mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the<br>spatula from side to side across the top to level it.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When<br>the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit<br>and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the<br>middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake<br>for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery<br>crust and the sides are just beginning to come away<br>from the tin. Take out of the oven.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold,<br>then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the<br>protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out<br>on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the<br>brownie with the foil (or parchment). Cut into quarters,<br>then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into<br>triangles.</li>
       <br>
       <li>They’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two<br>weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.</li>
