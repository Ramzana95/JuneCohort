set price on top of that. totalItems go up one at a time. If we only want one of these to change, we
would take out the one we don't want to change from the return statement
If you only want to make changes to one thing (total or item), we would use a "spreader"
- A spreader is saying that we want to take a snapshot of both items and in any other changes we want to see
 happening, the spreader will keep track of both items or the number of items in our object
