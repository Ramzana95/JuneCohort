/* DOMS
- DOCUMENT OBJECT MANIPULATION
We get to see Javascript come to life

Apply what we've learnt from Javascript, html, and css in one place

User is able to interact with the website + website is able to react back based off of the user's 
suggestions/clicks/implementations

DOMs is a way for Javascript to communicate with a website.
JS (functional/logical language) communicates with the mark up language. (The mark up language 
in this case is html and css(they make it look pretty but JS is where all the logic and
thought processes happen))

e.g. dark mode buttons on websites - all the logics behind these features are happening
due to the use of Javascript but it works with the html and css

DOMs is a part of the internet, virtual DOM exists inside the "inspect element"

When you hard-write code, a user can't update that hard-written code unless they have
access to your code
-- This is where virtual DOMs comes into play - a user is able to make small changes on the 
virtual DOM (in the "inspect element") and update a website through the virtual DOM.

-- if someone was to make an actual saved change to the website where those changes would be 
seen by everyone else who uses the website, they wouldn't be able to. (IF YOU MAKE A CHANGE
TO A WEBSITE AND SOMEONE ELSE GOES ON THAT SAME WEBSITE, THEY WOULDN'T SEE THE CHANGES)

-- In order to make ACTUAL HARD-WRITTEN CHANGES to a website that EVERYONE can see, you would 
need access to the code. (NO ONE SHOULD HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO YOUR CODE)

AS A USER HOW DO WE MAKE CHANGES TO THE VIRTUAL DOM (i.e. small changes?

Having the developer or owner of the original script create user interactions that they are
expecting the user to want to change?  
e.g. the dark mode/light mode preferences 
-- previously, all websites were hard-written to have light backgorunds or white backgrounds,
website owners/developers get feedback
-- you start to see how websites adjust and are made more user friendly. Developers almost predict
what the users would want in order to enjoy using their websites more

e.g. more and more people want the option of dark mode so more and more websites offer a
dark mode option now which we as users can manipulate according to our preferences

As a developer, you can't predict what users will do so you can't make a JS script for your
website that will give users the option to change every single preference 

- You can only predict certain things that you would want the user to be able to change when they
access your website

e.g. of a user interaction on a website:

- you predict that a user will use a search bar to search for something in the website
-This search bar is an option, the user can use it if they want or they can search through
the website manually

- BAD websites are the ones that FORCE a user to do something that they don't want to do
e.g. not giving the user the option of a search bar or making a website ONLY in dark mode

end goal is for the user to WANT to use your website*/
