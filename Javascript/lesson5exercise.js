// Loops

//create a loop which checks if numbers are odd or even. Start point = 0 End point = 100

for (let i=0; i<=100; i=i+1)//one at a time
if (i%2 === 0){// this is just saying every 2 numbers starting from 0
    console.log (i+ " is an even number")
}else{
    console.log (i+ " is an odd number")
}
