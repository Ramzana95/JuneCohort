console.log("Hello, this is my first homework for Javascript.")
 //q1. Using string concatenation add two different strings together and print this off.
 console.log("Hello"+"world!")
 /*This prints the strings without a space in between. to create a space, you must put a space between 
 the first word and the end of the quotation mark, or you can 
 put a space between the quotation mark and the start of the second word. e.g.*/
console.log("Hello " + "world!") //or
console.log("Hello" + " world!") //or
console.log("Hello" + " " + "world!")

/*Another way of creating a space between two strings is by creating variables e.g.*/
var firstWord = "Hello"
var secondWord = "world!"
console.log(firstWord + " " + secondWord)


//q2. Using variables, create a variable for a number and a string, then print each of these variables.
var firstWord = "Hello"
var secondWord = 2
console.log(firstWord + " " + secondWord)
console.log(firstWord)
console.log(secondWord)

/* Using string concatenation in JS, combine 3 different variables and print them off.
i.e. a variable for name, age, and DOB will result in "my name is Ramzan I am 28 years
old and I was born in 1995". (You cannot use name, age, and DOB as your variables.)*/

var name = "Ramzan"
var age = 28
var dob = 1995
console.log("my name is", name,  "I am", age,
"years old and I was born in", dob)
