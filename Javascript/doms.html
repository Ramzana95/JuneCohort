    <!-- How do we make changes onto our html page through DOMs?

        first, add your <script> </script> tags. This is where the Javascript exists on a html 
        page. This is a bit like how we can make inline css changes e.g. <body width= 100px> etc.
        Also similar to creating a <style> </style> tage in the <head> and making css style 
        changes there.

        You can add all of your Javascript in between the <script> </script> tags and this will
        be applied to the website.

        Another way of adding and applying Javascript to your websites is by linking/referencing 
        a JS file like this: (NOTE: the file linked has to be in the same folder)
        -->
